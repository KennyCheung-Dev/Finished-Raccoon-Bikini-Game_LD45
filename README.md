# Finished Raccoon Bikini Game
Unity Puzzle Game - submission for Ludamdare 45 Game Jam
 
Finished Raccoon Bikini Game is a Unity puzzle game built by a team of artists and programmers for the Ludamdare 45 Game Jam. The jam lasted for 72 hours and 2611 games were submitted. The theme was “Start with nothing”.

An inventory of objects is provided to players including platforms, bikinis and the racoon. Players are able to drag the objects onto the play area to composite the level. Player can play and test out their composition anytime and retry infinitely.

The puzzle aspect comes from the constraints on how players can use the objects. Some objects are wrapped around a colour outline, which indicates that the objects can only be dragged onto area on the screen with the same colour. The coloured area, objects provided and their colour is predefined and allow us to define variety of creative puzzles.
